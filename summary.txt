Interpro displays two complementary domain annotations:
'Representative domains' are consensus sequence-based annotations derived from databases such as Pfam, SMART etc.
'TED domains' are automatically predicted structure-based segments from AlphaFold models.
Representative domains reflect curated functional units while TED domains reflect compact structural units that may merge, split or overlap those curated regions.

Representative domains

Representative domains are derived from overlapping models from InterPro’s member databases (e.g. Pfam, SMART, TIGRFAMs, CDD, ProSite). InterPro merges these when they describe the same biological function and keeps one as a “representative” entry.
Each underlying member database uses its own annotation method, such as:
	Pfam / SMART – profile HMMs trained from multiple sequence alignments (MSA + HMM)

	ATH-Gene3D – structure-based HMMs derived from 3D domain definitions	

	DD – PSSMs (position-specific scoring matrices)

	roSite – regular expression–style sequence motifs or profiles

TED domains
These are structure-based domains automatically predicted from AlphaFold models using CATH's 3D domain segmentation algorithms. The aim is to partition the continuous 3d model into independently folding units; domains. These domains are usually shorted than the "Representative domains" from InterPro.

For searching domains and their coordinates, I have created a python script that queries InterPro for a given accession and returns
- representative domains if representative_only==True
- all domains if representative_only==False
