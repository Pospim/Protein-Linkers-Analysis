Interpro displays two complementary domain annotations:
'Representative domains' are consensus sequence-based annotations derived from databases such as Pfam, SMART etc.
'TED domains' are automatically predicted strucure-based segments from AlphaFOld models.
Representative domains reflkect curated functional units while TED domains reflect compact structural units that may merge, split or overal those curated regions.


For searching domains and their coordinates, I have created a python script that queries InterPro for a given accession and returns
- representative domains if representative_only==True
- all domains if representative_only==False

I also enables me to specify source databases.
